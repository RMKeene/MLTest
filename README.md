LOG of work thought and process:

3/12/2020
The code has little error checking.  I believe the purpose of this programming test is to 
look at ideas on matching students to courses, so that is the focus.
More maintainable code would be better for actual production code, with unit tests and much more.

Also much of the focus here is that the main.py be easily runnable. So lots of conditional setup is done
on-the-fly if not already done.

- Python 3.8
- PyCharm
- Made Git Project https://github.com/RMKeene/MLTest
- Initial checkin of empty project
